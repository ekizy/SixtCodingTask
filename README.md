# For unit tests generated databinding and dagger classes are ignored. Fragments and activity tests will be implemented in instrumented tests. Mocks are provided from Mockito library.

# Libraries and their versions can be seen in dependencies.gradle file. There are some 3rd party libraries such as Mockito, Glide(for pictures)

# Finally after fetching the repository in order to use the google maps, for debug and release targets google_maps_api.xml files  should be created. Afterwards for these files a unique API Key should be used. This key can be generated from developer console.
